# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly).

The project uses hashed passwords and user sessions to maintain user security. This application allows user account creation to store, maintain and monitor private shortened URLs. Analytics about total visits, unique visitors and visit history are provided to the URL owner.
